# CSE 110: Software Engineering

## **Who am I?**
 My name is Cristian Antonio Hernandez, a second year transfer student and Math - CS major at _UCSD_  My interests are in applied mathematics, in particular, optimization, and computer science. What inspired me to start programming was my interest in video games, I wanted to undstand how a game was what makes a character move, act, etc, but more importantly, what made the game so ~~addicting~~ fun.

 > ***The code doesn't work...WHY?*** - Most programmers 

Use syntax when programming in languages that require it. 

e.g. Java:  `System.out.println("Hello World!");`

An example of a program in C++:
```
#include <iostream>

using namespace;
int main()
{
    cout << "Hello World!" << endl;   
    return 0; 
}
```
